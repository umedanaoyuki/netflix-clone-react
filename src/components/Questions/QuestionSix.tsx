                    The Netflix Kids experience is included in your membership to give parents control while kids enjoy
                    family-friendly TV shows and movies in their own space.

                    Kids profiles come with PIN-protected parental controls that let you restrict the maturity rating of
                    content kids can watch and block specific titles you donâ€™t want kids to see.
